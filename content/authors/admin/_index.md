I am a Research Economist in the Monetary Policy Department at De Nederlandsche Bank.  

I obtained my PhD at the European University Institute in Florence under the supervision of Evi Pappa and Leonardo Melosi. During my PhD, I visited the University of California at Berkeley and have been a PhD Trainee in the Monetary Policy Strategy Division at the European Central Bank.

My research interests include macroeconomics, monetary policy, applied macroeconometrics and inflation expectations. You can find my CV [here.](files/CV.pdf)
