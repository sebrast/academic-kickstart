abstract: We estimate a model of long-run inflation expectations using panel data from the
US Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). Professional forecasters are affected by
common persistence bias and overconfidence in private information and these two
deviations from rationality allow the model to account for the sluggish dynamics of
expectations and the large and persistent disagreement in the SPF. Expectations respond
negligibly to short-term changes in inflation and become less coordinated during the
two zero-lower-bound episodes. At the end of 2022, the model correctly predicts that
de-anchoring of US inflation expectations would not occur if inflation fell in 2023 as
quickly as it actually did.
