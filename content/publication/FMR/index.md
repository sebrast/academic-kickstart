abstract: We estimate a model of individual long-run inflation expectations when inflation follows a trend-cycle time series process with panel data from the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters. We use our model to study average long-run expectations when individual forecasters know the inflation process, observe inflation and receive common and idiosyncratic signals about long-run inflation. We find coordination of sentiments around the inflation target prevented expectations from becoming unanchored in the face of inflation running persistently below target in the 2010s. We apply our model to study the case of a U.S. central banker setting policy in December 2015 when inflation had been running below target for many years, and in December 2022 when it had been running very hot for a year and a half. We find that if the projections from the Fedâ€™ December Summary of Economic Projections were realized they would be inconsistent with preventing long-run inflation expectations from become unanchored. This is so even with sentiments coordinated in a manner consistent with their historical behavior. In the most recent episode we find that the common signal is relatively imprecise and so it is even harder for sentiments about long-run inflation to be coordinated.
